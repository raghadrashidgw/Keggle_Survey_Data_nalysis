# Project Overview
This project analyzes data from the Kaggle Machine Learning and Data Science Survey to uncover trends in machine learning framework and programming language usage. The goal is to identify which frameworks and languages are most popular among different experience levels and how their adoption varies. 
The objectives:
1. Aggregating and visualizing both framework and programming language usage by job titles and experience level.
2. Identifying trends in framework and language preferences among beginners, intermediate users, and experts.
3. Generating insights to help data scientists, researchers, and organizations understand the evolving landscape of ML tools and programming languages.
4. The findings will be presented using data visualizations such as heatmaps, bar charts, and trend graphs for clearer interpretation.


# Data

## Source Data
https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2021/data


## Data Preprocessing
The dataset consists of responses from the 2021 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey, where each question is spread across multiple columns. For example, the question "What programming languages do you use on a regular basis?" is divided into up to eight columns, with each column representing a specific language. If a respondent selected Python, it appears in one column while the others remain empty, and the same applies to SQL, R, Java, and other languages.




# Results and evaluation
  ## Programming Language Preferences
 1. Python dominated as the most popular language across all experience levels.
 2. SQL was commonly used alongside Python, highlighting its importance in data handling.
 3. C++ is also used mostly by Students.
  ## Machine Learning Framework Usage
  1. TensorFlow was the second most used framework, primarily adopted by users with 1 to 3 years of experience.
  2. Keras, while also popular, had fewer users compared to TensorFlow and was mostly used by those with less than 3 years of experience.
  3. Scikit-learn remained one of the most widely used frameworks across all experience levels.
 
# Future work
In the future, this project could be enhanced by:
1. adding more data from other surveys or reports to compare trends over time.
2.  analyzing people's opinions on the frameworks and languages they use.
3.  analysis on specific job titles or exploring a specific problem statment in detail can help in coming up with better insights. 

# How to run the codes
The code are listed as cells with each cell has a corresponding output. You can find the notebook attatched and there are comments on which approaches we used and why those approaches were used.

# Acknowledgments/References
I express my sincere gratitude to my instructors, Mr. Juan Orozco and Mr Ali El-Kassas for their dedication in this course, their invaluable guidance and support throughout this project. A special thanks to Mr Juan for heping us with a suggestion to handle the EDA part! and Mr Ali for his fruitful feedback. Also, I would also like to thank my project partner for their collaboration, hard work. Working together has been a rewarding experience.
