# Insights from the Kaggle Survey: Trends in Data science, machine learning and related data feilds



# Project Overview
This project analyzes data from the Kaggle Machine Learning and Data Science Survey to uncover trends in machine learning framework and programming language usage. The goal is to identify which frameworks and languages are most popular among different experience levels and how their adoption varies. 
The objectives:
1. Aggregating and visualizing both framework and programming language usage by job titles and experience level.
2. Identifying trends in framework and language preferences among beginners, intermediate users, and experts.
3. Generating insights to help data scientists, researchers, and organizations understand the evolving landscape of ML tools and programming languages.
4. The findings will be presented using data visualizations such as heatmaps, bar charts, and trend graphs for clearer interpretation.


# Data

## Source Data

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset consists of responses from the 2021 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey, where each question is spread across multiple columns. For example, the question "What programming languages do you use on a regular basis?" is divided into up to eight columns, with each column representing a specific language. If a respondent selected Python, it appears in one column while the others remain empty, and the same applies to SQL, R, Java, and other languages.
